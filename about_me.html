  <h2>School: Santa Ana High School</h2>
  <h2 id="first">The only PLTW program I have taken was in 8th grade and it was called Automation and Robotics.</h2>
  <h2 id="second">I've earned a Graphic Design Certificate and that's pretty much it. Iv'e earned other certificates in my Robotics class but they were pretty much participation awards just for completing tasks. </h2>
  <h2 id="third">I chose to take this course because I would see coding videos online so I was curious to find out what it was like to code.</h2>
  <h2 id="fourth">Some personal interests I have are gaming and watching baseball.My dad would play baseball on the weekends so I would watch him play and now I watch baseball. About 10 years ago, my cousin gave me his copy of Call of Duty Modern Wafare 2 and ever since,I play from time to time.I don't really play the newer ones because they release unfinished most of the time so I just stick with the older titles.</h2>
