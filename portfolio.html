        <p>Linux is a operating system that is similar to Apple's macOS and Microsoft's Windows systems.But what's special about Linux is that the user can customize it to their own liking. The version I picked was Linux Lite because it was very easy to navigate if you are familiar with a Windows setting.I installed this program by downloading it onto a flashdrive and inserting it into a refurbished computer. I then set it up on a virtual machine application, messed with the settings, and it worked.Linux Lite is basically the same thing as Windows but not owned by Microsoft. </p>

        <p>The goal of the Spectrum V project was to emulate the real life version of Spectrum V by Ellsworth Kelly. I created my version of Spectrum V by using HTML to use a table to sort the different rectangles. Then I used CSS to style each rectangle to my own color pallete. Finally, I also used CSS to style the title with a custom font that I picked from online.But I also used the margin tag to customize how centered the rectangles were going to be. With just the margin tag, you can type in 'center' and it will center whatever you have in the center of the screen.</p>
